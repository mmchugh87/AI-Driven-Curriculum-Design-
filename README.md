## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **ImportError: No module named 'camoufox'**
```bash
pip install camoufox camoufox-captcha
```

#### 2. **Cloudflare Challenge Not Resolving**
- The script will attempt automatic solving
- If it fails, manual intervention will be required
- Follow the on-screen prompts

#### 3. **No Jobs Found**
- Check if the search terms are valid
- Verify Indeed.com is accessible
- Try different search parameters

#### 4. **Browser Won't Start**
- Ensure Camoufox is properly installed
- Try running in headless mode by setting `headless=True`

### Performance Tips

1. **Reduce job count** for faster testing:
   ```bash
   python indeed_scraper_camoufox.py "data scientist" "remote" 50
   ```

2. **Disable full descriptions** for faster scraping:
   ```python
   scrape_full_descriptions=False
   ```

3. **Use headless mode** on servers:
   ```python
   'headless': True
   ```
